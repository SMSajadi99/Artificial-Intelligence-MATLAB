# Artificial Intelligence MATLAB

In this course, three of the most widely used tools in the field of artificial intelligence, including: optimization with genetic algorithms, neural networks and fuzzy inference engines, are presented. 

Learning these three tools is very effective in understanding the concepts of intelligence. Also, these three tools are widely used in interaction with other intelligent and specialized tools such as: image processing, deep learning, data mining, etc.
